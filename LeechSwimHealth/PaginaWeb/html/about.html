        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            LeechSwimHealth only consists of a plug-in, which checks the correct swimming of the leech from the sinusoidal curves that it generates, 
            for this it is necessary to enter at least two images taken from the same video of the leech, since if taken from different videos or with 
            different backgrounds, the program will return erroneous results, also there should be no objects such as tweezers, hands, rulers, among others,
            in the image, since if that is the case, the plug-in will take them as leeches and will return erroneous results , in the following document you 
            can see the progress of how the plug-in was designed and implemented, in addition to the tests that were applied to verify its effectiveness.
